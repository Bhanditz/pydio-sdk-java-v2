The pydio java sdk provides a Java implementation of Pydio features for communicating with a Pydio server. All the features are wrapped by the PydioClient class that contains simple methods to do the main file system operations.

The data model:
--------------
Pydio model is based on the notion of tree. In fact a server is the root node of a tree which has WorkspaceNode as children. Each WorkspaceNode has a list of FileNodes as children which have other FileNodes as children too.
So a hierarchy is defined by an abstract Node class and concrete classes like ServerNode, WorkspaceNode and FileNode. 


Configuring a Pydio server:
--------------------------
Confuguring a Pydio server is configuring a ServerNode. The SDK provides two method for configuring a serverNode. A simple one that consist of setting manully the server properties, and the other one is based on a resolution process.

* Simple configuration
``` java
	//step 1: create an empty instance of a ServerNode using the NodeFactory
	ServerNode server = (ServerNode) NodeFactory.createNode(Node.TYPE_SERVER);

	//step 2: set server info like host, protocol, path, has self-signed ssl certicicate
	server.setHost("hostname");
	server.setPath("path_of_your_pydio_install");
	server.setSelfSigned(boolvalue); //only if the target server use self-signed certificate
	server.setLegacy(PYDIO_SERVER_VERSION > 5);	//for version pydio version greater than 5
```


* Resolution-based configuration

this case depend on the context in which you use the sdk. For example, let's suppose you're building an application that connect to a server that has not a fixed domain name or ip. But you have a way to retrieve it using a special protocol. The resolution process allows you to handle this case. The SDK provides an interface that need to be implemented to spÃ©cify the way your app retrieve te properties of your serverNode.
here is an exmaple of using a Resolver.
``` java
	...
	//step 1: create an instance of ServerResolver

	String KEY = "key";
	ServerResolver resolver = new ServerResolver(){
		@override
		public void resolve(ServerNode server){
			// do your resolution stuff here
			// and set your serverNode properties
		}
	};

	//step 2: register your resolver like this
	Resolution.register(KEY, resolver);
	ServerNode server = NodeFactory.createNode(Node.TYPE_SERVER);

	// specify that your serverNode properties need to resolved
	// by setting the hostname with the same key you've just 
	// when registering your resolver	
	server.setHost(KEY);
```

Creation of a Pydio Client:
--------------------------
The creation of a PydioClient is based on an an instance of a ServerNode and an instance of a credentials provider.
A credential provider is a an object that carry/fetches credentials for pydio authentication.
Here is the simplest way to instantiate a PydioClient:
``` java
	...
	PydioClient client = PydioClient.configure(server, new CredentialsProvider(){
        @Override
        public UsernamePasswordCredentials requestForLoginPassword() {
            return new UsernamePasswordCredentials("login", "password");
        }
        @Override
        public X509Certificate requestForCertificate() {
            return null;
        }
	});
```

Performing simple actions:
-------------------------
Once your pydio client is configured, you can start calling the client methods to perform file operations on your server.

>Note that PydioClient is design to perform asynchrone operations. So for operation that requires result like file listing, you need to pass 
a callback to process one by one every parsed node.
The example below stores and displays the name of each child of a given node.

``` java
	...
	final ArrayList<Node> children = new ArrayList<>();
	client.listChildren(givenNode, new NodeHandler(){
		@Override
		public void processNode(Node node){
			//filter to exclude the recyclebin file
			if(!node.label().equals("Recycle Bin")){
				System.out.println(node.label());
				children.add(node);
			}
		}
	}, offset, max);
	//note that is the given node is null, the client automatically list the workspaces of the serverNode.
	// the offset and max arguments are both integer that allows you to list only subset of the givenNode children
```
